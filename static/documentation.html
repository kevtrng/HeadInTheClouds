		<h3>Creating a Cloud</h3>
		To create a cloud enter your email, thought, and mood. Please
		ensure that you:
		<ul>
			<li>do not leave any fields blank</li>
			<li>enter an email with a valid format</li>
			<li>Enter a thought that is 1-50 characters long</li>
		</ul>
		If any of the above conditions are not met, your Cloud will
		not make it to the Cloud Wall!

		<h3> Viewing Clouds </h3>
		<p>The <a href="../anotherPage.php">Cloud Wall</a> allows you to view
		yours and other users' Clouds. </p>
		<p>
			Since we have an "endless scroll" format, our scroll to top
			button will ensure you don't have to scroll for miles to get
			back to the top of the page
		</p>

		<h3>Generating a Random Cloud</h3>
		<p>
			Okay there's literally a single button on the page that
			says "generate". I feel like you're not that incompetent.
